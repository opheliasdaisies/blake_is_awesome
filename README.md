Codename: Surfing
================

This is a private repo, for only BK-000 students. Only contributors can see it and only students in our class will be contributors. Please keep it a secret from Blake until we launch it! We are going to surprise him when we are done.

The idea of the site is to be an ode to Blake's vanity. Taking inspiration from the Dos Equis commerical (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U18VkI0uDxE), it would be nice to create a blake-centric commercial, but we'll probably start with a sudo one that reads lines as you scroll down. The punchline will be 'He is the Most Awesome Man in the World.'

Sara has graciously reserved the domain blakeisaweso.me for his majesty.

COLLABORATING
================
We can all collaborate on this, but want to avoid any merge conflicts, so please follow these guidelines:

GIT
--------------- 
To start, clone this repo in your main projects directory (no need for git init, or adding a remote when you do this). Make sure you are not in an existing repo.

Please make your commit messages as descriptive as possible so everyone can see how the site is evolving through Github. 

When you make any changes, make sure to always 'git pull' before 'git push' and don't forget to commit your changes early and often. If anything is acting funky, just ask us!


Finally, please be mindful of keeping it a secret from Blake and Ashley (i.e. not putting it up on the monitors when they are around and using code names).

YAY BK-000!

CONTRIBUTORS
================
This is a list of what people are working. If you want to contribute, just add your name to the list and let Sara/Nisha know before you start working on something to avoid any potential merge conflicts. 

Given the scope of the idea isn't terribly large and we are 28 people, if you have a different idea for the site, you can create a new route and implement your idea there.

If you just want to contribute ideas, that's cool too, just write them at the bottom.
